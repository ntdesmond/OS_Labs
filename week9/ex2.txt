The Hit/miss ratio greatly depends on uniqueness of entries in the page queue.


For instance, if we take a queue consisting of only a single number, repeated N times (e.g. 1 repeated 1000 times):

$ for i in {1..1000}; do echo 1 >> ex1.txt; done

The hit/miss ration will be equal to hit count, which is equal to N-1, since there is only 1 miss at the beginning.


Oh the other hand, if we generate a copletely unique sequence of N pages (let's use 1000 again):

$ seq 1000 > ex1.txt

Then the hit/miss ratio will be equal to 0, since we get 0 hits â€” each page is used only once and needs to be loaded
into the memory.
